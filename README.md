# VideoRec

## Purpose
Control the VHS/Video8/DVD/DV digitizing stations. This creates a simple interface, and uses OBS Studio to do the actual recording.

Note: the file simpleobsws.py needs to be manually added, since a pip install gets a newer version that uses different class names. It can be found at: https://github.com/IRLToolkit/simpleobsws/tree/simpleobsws-4.x
